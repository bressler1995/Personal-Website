# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React ecosystem. In this post, we'll explore how to get started with Next.js 14 and build modern web applications.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a great developer experience with features like:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- Built-in routing
- Image optimization
- And much more!

## Setting Up a New Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will prompt you with several options to configure your project. For a modern setup, I recommend:

- TypeScript for type safety
- App Router for the latest routing system
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality

## Key Features in Next.js 14

### Server Actions

Server Actions allow you to write server-side functions directly in your components:

```typescript
// app/actions.ts
'use server'

export async function createPost(data: FormData) {
  // Server-side logic here
}
```

### Partial Prerendering

Next.js 14 introduces Partial Prerendering, which combines the best of static and dynamic rendering:

```typescript
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <StaticContent />
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <DynamicContent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use the App Router**
   - Leverage the new file-based routing system
   - Take advantage of server components
   - Use layouts for shared UI

2. **Optimize Images**
   - Use the `next/image` component
   - Configure proper image sizes
   - Enable lazy loading

3. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Use error boundaries
   - Create custom error pages
   - Handle API errors gracefully

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. With its focus on performance, developer experience, and flexibility, it's an excellent choice for your next project.
